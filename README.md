because generating metrics to some people is akin to productivity, might as well give them metrics then
some other people believe they have any kind of control over what they can run on your home network, this is for them also

## concept
have a daemon run on computer B with intune installed and whatnot
have computer A on same LAN manage daemon as necessary as feature set grows

## dev steps
1. mvp with simple bot that just does random stuff on screen
2. analyze network traffic and find relevant calls (intune and other MS spyware)
3. spoof said calls directly on network level and be done with this stupid shit

## cool to have
- forward specific traffic from computer A without intune through computer B with intune (for specific websites)

## honorable mention
to the system that thinks it can control what its employees does in their own homes.
without you this wouldn't be possible.
